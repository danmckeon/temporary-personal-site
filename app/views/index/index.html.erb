      <p>I build cool things with JavaScript. I’m currently working on Avalara’s Skylab design system. Much of my front-end experience is in React, but since mid-2019, I’ve been sticking to web standards, using vanilla JavaScript and diving deep into CSS and the core browser APIs.

      <p>Clinical trials have a participant satisfaction rate of more than 90%, yet less than 5% of cancer patients participate. Not enough patients (and doctors) know what trials are available to them. Patients need more options. Researchers need more participants. CRC connects these two groups by making information on clinical trials much easier to find. To do so, we scrape publicly available government filings for clinical trials and make them easily searchable for the average person. Our current application includes both lung and colorectal cancer trials, but we plan to extend to other types in the coming months.</p>

      <p>The Giving Group specializes in collecting and distributing funds to charitable causes for donation groups or giving circles. It is built on a Node back end and deployed on AWS Lambda through Claudia using a NoSQL (DynamoDB) database. I built the user portal for this app, set up a number of API endpoints for our clients, and designed custom features for one of the largest giving groups in the nation. I also transitioned the legacy application to AngularJS and built our donation submission UI and related services.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
      </div>
      <p>I'm a software engineer based in beautiful Seattle, WA. I'm passionate about empowering people through technology. For over a year, I've been building a web application called Cancer Research Connect (CRC) that helps people who have cancer find clinical trials. We recently launched the site and are continuing to build out the database and search engine to make this technology as accurate and accessible for as many people as possible. I've been self-teaching programming for years and in early 2017 attended Dev Bootcamp to improve my understanding of software engineering concepts. For our final project, I served as team lead as we built the <a href="https://www.crconnect.org" target="_blank">CRC prototype website</a> using a React User Interface and Ruby on Rails for the API. I'm eager to learn new technologies and particularly to further build my skillset in React. Prior to Dev Bootcamp, I spent much of my career as a consultant to natural and organic food companies, helping them to achieve their sales and marketing goals. When I'm not building applications, you're likely to find me hiking, climbing, or backpacking in the Pacific Northwest or while traveling.</p>
